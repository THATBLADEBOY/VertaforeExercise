# VertaforeExercise
Console application solving the following questions:

## Question 1

Write an application that satisfies the following:

* Small application

* Given a fully sorted array (ascending or descending), write a method to scramble the values e.g. (7, 13, 13, 18, 29, 33)

* Write the code with use-ability, debugging, and testing in mind.

 

## Question 2 (2, 3, build off each other)


* Consider the following style of abbreviation:

*   (first letter) + (count of removed letters) + (last letter)

* For example:

*   "internationalization" -> "i18n"

*   "localization" -> "l10n"

* Write a function that given a word returns its abbreviation.

 

## Question 3


* Such abbreviations are not always unique, for example:

*   "accessibility" -> "a11y"

*   "automatically" -> "a11y"

* Given a dictionary (a list of words), write a function that takes a word and

* returns true if the abbreviation of the word is unique in the dictionary.



* For example, given a dictionary with the 4 words above:

*   "internationalization" -> true

*   "localization" -> true

*   "accessibility" -> false

*   "automatically" -> false
